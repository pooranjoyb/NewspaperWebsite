# NewspaperWebsite

Welcome to my first simple and responsive Newspaper website created using basic HTML &amp; CSS.
Check this project by cloning it to your PC using Gitbash or the Download/Clone button.

**Using Gitbash**

Open Gitbash 

Copy the following command to clone this repository in your local storage:
```
git clone https://github.com/pooranjoyb/NewspaperWebsite.git
```
Hit the Enter key.

It would take a few seconds to clone the repository onto your system.
Note: Please note that cloning depends on the internet connection and the time would depend on your connection bandwidth. If Git is not able to clone due to a weak connection, it would display a fatal error and the user is requested to try again until the above message does not appear.

Check in the local drive by navigating to it manually.

**Open the index.html file to view the project**
